Are you a developer seeking a seamless way to experiment with GitHub Gists for Front-End projects? Look no further! [PlayGist](https://playgist.dev) is here to simplify your coding endeavors. This innovative web fiddle offers a unique platform for running, sharing, and exploring your GitHub Gists without the need for extensive cloud storage. Let's delve into the exciting features that make PlayGist a valuable addition to your development toolkit.

**Evolution from "NPM Playground":** PlayGist is akin to its predecessor, "NPM Playground." However, it brings a significant improvement by eliminating the cloud storage constraints that held back its forerunner. With PlayGist, you can code without worrying about storage limitations, giving you the freedom to create and run your Front-End projects efficiently.

**Revamped Design:** The user interface might appear familiar, but it's not just a simple makeover. PlayGist has undergone a complete rewrite, transitioning from the Lit framework to Next.js. This transformation ensures a more robust and seamless experience, offering you a powerful development environment right in your browser.

**GitHub API Rate Limit:** It's important to note that PlayGist operates within the boundaries of GitHub's API rate limits. However, we've got you covered. By simply logging in to your GitHub account, you can bypass these limitations and access the full potential of PlayGist.

Here are some key features that make PlayGist a developer's dream:

**Flexible File Creation:** You can effortlessly create JavaScript (JS), JSX, TypeScript (TS), and TypeScript JSX (TSX) files within PlayGist. While you can't create folders due to our integration with GitHub Gists, you can import these files seamlessly. Just remember to keep the file extension intact when importing (e.g., `import "./component-a.tsx"`).

**ES Modules and Top-Level Await:** PlayGist encourages modern development practices. You must use ES modules, and we fully support top-level `await`. This ensures that your code remains cutting-edge and ready for the latest web standards.

**Bare Specifiers for Node Packages:** Harness the power of Node packages compatible with browsers. PlayGist enables you to use bare specifiers for these packages, which will be automatically looked up on a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This seamless integration simplifies the process of including third-party libraries in your projects.

**Local and Remote CSS Support:** Importing CSS is a breeze with PlayGist. Local CSS files can be imported directly from modules using `import "./style.css"`. For remote CSS resources, you need to create a local CSS file that references the remote resource with a full URL. This flexibility allows you to style your projects the way you prefer.

**HTML Files on the Horizon:** While HTML files are not currently supported, stay tuned for future updates. When HTML support is added, it will adhere to the "body content only" limitation known from platforms like CodePen, ensuring a seamless transition for web developers.

**Fully Open Source:** PlayGist is a fully open-source project, and you can explore its codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomas-wrobel/playgist). We believe in the power of community-driven development, and your contributions are always welcome.

With PlayGist, your GitHub Gists become more than just code snippetsâ€”they become fully functional, interactive Front-End projects. Explore, experiment, and collaborate with ease in this developer-friendly environment. Join us in redefining the way you code with GitHub Gists. Welcome to the future of web fiddling.
