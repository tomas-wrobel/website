If you have ever visited this web, 
you may notice that it has changed a lot. 
I have been working on a new design for a 
while and I am very happy with the result. 
I hope you like it too!

Since my old web was open source,
it can be found on my GitHub account 
and [here](https://tomas-wrobel.github.io/)
