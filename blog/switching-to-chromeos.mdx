I know what you're thinking. If you do know Chrome OS, you will kill me. Otherwise, you may ask what
it is.

### What is Chrome OS?

Chrome OS is an operating system made by Google. It powers Chromebooks and Pixelbooks. It has some
nice features &ndash; Google Assitant, Android and Linux (meaning Debian) built-in. However, if you
need more than web, it is problematic. Most of the Android apps are not ready for laptops and Linux
is running inside VM, which is not performant at all.

Without Windows you cannot:

-   use Microsoft Visual Studio
-   use Microsoft Office

But you can:

-   use Visual Studio Code
-   use ADB with the built-in Linux & Android
-   enjoy Android games

### Why did I choose Chrome OS?

I won't lie. The only reason I bought a Chromebook was its price. I bought refurbished one from
Poland for around $60. I can use Visual Studio Code for the web development, so it is enough. I can
use Node.js too.
